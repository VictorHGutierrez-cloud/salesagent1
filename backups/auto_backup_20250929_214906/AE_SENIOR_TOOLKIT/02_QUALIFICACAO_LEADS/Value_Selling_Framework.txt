â€¢ "Que custos ocultos vocÃªs identificam?"
â€¢ "Qual o custo de oportunidade da situaÃ§Ã£o atual?"
â€¢ "Quanto vocÃªs investem em retrabalho?"

EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENT:
â€¢ "Quantas horas/mÃªs sÃ£o gastas em atividades manuais?"
â€¢ "Qual a taxa de erro dos processos atuais?"
â€¢ "Quanto tempo leva cada processo crÃ­tico?"
â€¢ "Que gargalos limitam performance?"

2. DESIRED FUTURE STATE:
========================

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES:
â€¢ "Onde vocÃªs querem estar em 12 meses?"
â€¢ "Que objetivos estratÃ©gicos dependem do RH?"

3. GAP ANALYSIS:
===============

PERFORMANCE GAPS:
â€¢ Current state vs desired state
â€¢ Competitive positioning gaps
â€¢ Efficiency opportunity gaps
â€¢ Capability requirement gaps

IMPACT QUANTIFICATION:
â€¢ Financial impact of gaps
â€¢ Operational impact
â€¢ Strategic impact
â€¢ Risk impact

VALUE QUANTIFICATION MODEL:
===========================

FINANCIAL VALUE CATEGORIES:
===========================

1. REVENUE GENERATION:
=====================

REVENUE UPLIFT:
â€¢ Faster hiring = faster growth
â€¢ Better hiring = better performance
â€¢ Improved retention = sustained growth
â€¢ Enhanced employer brand = competitive advantage

CALCULATION FRAMEWORK:
Revenue Impact = (Additional Revenue from Faster Growth) + (Revenue Protection from Better Retention) + (Premium Revenue from Employer Brand)

EXAMPLE:
â€¢ 30% faster hiring = 3 months faster growth = R$ 500k additional revenue
â€¢ 20% better retention = R$ 200k saved replacement costs
â€¢ Improved employer brand = 15% premium on talent = R$ 300k value
Total Revenue Value: R$ 1M/year

2. COST REDUCTION:
=================

OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS:
â€¢ Reduced manual work
â€¢ Eliminated errors
â€¢ Faster processes
â€¢ Lower compliance costs

CALCULATION FRAMEWORK:
Cost Savings = (Time Savings Ã— Hourly Rate) + (Error Reduction Ã— Error Cost) + (Process Efficiency Ã— Volume)

EXAMPLE:
â€¢ 60 hours/month saved Ã— R$ 100/hour = R$ 72k/year
â€¢ 90% error reduction Ã— R$ 5k/error Ã— 10 errors/month = R$ 540k/year
â€¢ 75% faster processes Ã— high-value activities = R$ 200k/year
Total Cost Savings: R$ 812k/year

3. RISK MITIGATION:
==================

COMPLIANCE VALUE:
â€¢ Avoided fines and penalties
â€¢ Reduced audit costs
â€¢ Improved compliance score
â€¢ Lower insurance premiums

CALCULATION FRAMEWORK:
Risk Value = (Probability of Risk Ã— Cost of Risk) - (Probability with Solution Ã— Cost with Solution)

EXAMPLE:
â€¢ 20% chance of R$ 500k fine without solution = R$ 100k expected cost
â€¢ 2% chance of R$ 500k fine with solution = R$ 10k expected cost
â€¢ Risk mitigation value = R$ 90k/year

4. PRODUCTIVITY GAINS:
=====================

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS:
â€¢ Faster decision making
â€¢ Improved data quality
â€¢ Enhanced reporting capabilities
â€¢ Better resource allocation

CALCULATION FRAMEWORK:
Productivity Value = (Efficiency Gain % Ã— Current Output Value) + (Quality Improvement Ã— Impact Value)

EXAMPLE:
â€¢ 40% efficiency gain on R$ 2M RH operation = R$ 800k value
â€¢ Quality improvement enables 25% better decisions = R$ 300k value
Total Productivity Value: R$ 1.1M/year

VALUE-BASED PRICING STRATEGY:
=============================

PRICING PHILOSOPHY:
==================

TRADITIONAL PRICING:
Cost + Margin = Price

VALUE-BASED PRICING:
Value Delivered Ã— Value Capture % = Price

VALUE CAPTURE PRINCIPLES:
â€¢ Price based on value delivered
â€¢ Customer receives majority of value
â€¢ Price reflects transformation magnitude
â€¢ Investment is risk-adjusted
â€¢ Success is shared between parties

PRICING MODELS:
==============

1. VALUE-SHARE PRICING:
======================

MODEL:
Price = X% of quantified value delivered

EXAMPLE:
â€¢ Total value delivered: R$ 1M/year
â€¢ Value share: 20%
â€¢ Annual pricing: R$ 200k

BENEFITS:
â€¢ Aligned incentives
â€¢ Customer success focus
â€¢ Scalable with value
â€¢ Risk sharing

2. OUTCOME-BASED PRICING:
========================

MODEL:
Base price + outcome bonuses

EXAMPLE:
â€¢ Base price: R$ 100k/year
â€¢ ROI bonus: 10% of excess ROI above 200%
â€¢ Efficiency bonus: R$ 20k for each 10% efficiency gain

BENEFITS:
â€¢ Performance incentives
â€¢ Risk mitigation
â€¢ Continuous improvement
â€¢ Long-term partnership

3. RISK-ADJUSTED PRICING:
========================

MODEL:
Price varies based on implementation risk

EXAMPLE:
â€¢ Low risk (proven use case): Full price
â€¢ Medium risk (new application): 20% discount + success fee
â€¢ High risk (innovative use): 40% discount + significant success fee

BENEFITS:
â€¢ Risk appropriate pricing
â€¢ Innovation encouragement
â€¢ Mutual risk sharing
â€¢ Trust building

VALUE COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES:
==============================

FINANCIAL LANGUAGE:
==================

FOR CFOs:
â€¢ "ROI of 400% in first year"
â€¢ "Payback period of 6 months"
â€¢ "NPV of R$ 2.5M over 5 years"
â€¢ "IRR of 85%"
â€¢ "Cash flow positive from month 7"

BUSINESS LANGUAGE:
=================

FOR CEOs:
â€¢ "Competitive advantage through operational excellence"
â€¢ "Scale-ready infrastructure for 5x growth"
â€¢ "Risk mitigation in critical business processes"
â€¢ "Strategic capability development"
â€¢ "Market leadership positioning"

OPERATIONAL LANGUAGE:
====================

FOR CHROs:
â€¢ "80% reduction in manual work"
â€¢ "90% improvement in accuracy"
â€¢ "50% faster decision making"
â€¢ "100% compliance assurance"
â€¢ "Strategic focus enablement"

VALUE OBJECTION HANDLING:
=========================

"TOO EXPENSIVE":
===============

TRADITIONAL RESPONSE:
"Let me show you our payment options..."

VALUE RESPONSE:
"I understand it seems like a significant investment. Let's look at it differently - what's the cost of not solving this problem? Based on our analysis, the status quo costs you R$ 800k/year. Our solution costs R$ 200k/year and delivers R$ 1M in value. Which option costs more?"

"NO BUDGET":
============

TRADITIONAL RESPONSE:
"When would budget be available?"

VALUE RESPONSE:
"Budget challenges are real, but let's think about this strategically. The value we deliver pays for itself in 6 months. Essentially, you're using the savings from months 7-12 to fund the entire investment. Would your CFO approve a self-funding investment that delivers 400% ROI?"

"NOT PRIORITY RIGHT NOW":
========================

TRADITIONAL RESPONSE:
"When would be a better time?"

VALUE RESPONSE:
"I understand priorities shift, but consider this: every month you delay costs R$ 75k in lost value. After 6 months, you've lost more value than our entire solution costs. Can you afford for this not to be a priority?"
